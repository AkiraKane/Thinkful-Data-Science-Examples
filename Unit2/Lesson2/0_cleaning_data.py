# for this lesson I will be diverging from the Thinkful material and using
# the Kaggle Titanic dataset instead (train.csv). This is a far dirtier and,
# in many ways, more realistic exmaple of the datasets in you might encounter.
# I highly encourage you all to dl and work along with these examples as well as
# working the lesson exercises.
